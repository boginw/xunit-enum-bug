# XUnit Enum Bug

Usage:

```bash
`TESTLANG=[language here] dotnet test`
```

## What Locales are Failing?

The file `./test.sh` will run the tests against all the locales in `locales.txt`. Since there's a lot of locales the
tests are run in parallel with the usage of [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/), and as such it must
be installed to run the tests.

You can run the tests with:

```bash
./test.sh | tee failed.txt
```

The repository is prepopulated with a list of failing locales where the locales are generated by the following:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Globalization;
				
public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        foreach (var locale in CultureInfo.GetCultures(CultureTypes.AllCultures))
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine(locale);
        }
    }
}
```
